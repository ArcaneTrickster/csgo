* You should practice at aim bot everyday, for a fair amount of time. Aim bot is a workshop mod for cs:go and you have to go to csgo workshop to find it and install it into your game. then go to ingame workshop tab and select your desired mod.
* Your sideways speed doesnâ€™t reach its maximum immediately unless you run sideways for a fair amount of distance. Usecase:-
  * You should peek from a wall while while running side-ways from a fair amount of distance, instead of peeking right next to a wall.
